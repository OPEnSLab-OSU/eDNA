{\Huge \bf {\it HardwareX} article template} \textbf{Version 2 (June 2021)}\\
\vskip 0.5cm
{\bf Before you complete this template, a few important points to note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$]Unsure whether your designs would make a suitable hardware article? Visit our webpage \href{https://www.journals.elsevier.com/hardwarex/submit-your-hardware/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hardwarex}{\underline{Everything you need to know about {\it HardwareX}}.}
\item[$\bullet$]The format of a hardware article is very different to a traditional research article. To help you write yours, we have created this template. {\bf We will only consider hardware articles submitted using this template.}
\item[$\bullet$]{\it HardwareX} is dedicated to the communication of advances in open source scientific infrastructure. {\bf By submitting to the journal, you are confirming that all the information necessary to reproduce your design/hardware is communicated in full and is accessible for use under an open source license.} 
\item[$\bullet$]It is important that the designs referred to in your {\it HardwareX} article are {\bf publicly available.} You’ll find information on our hardware sharing criteria in the template. Not sure how to prepare your hardware for sharing? The \href{https://www.oshwa.org/sharing-best-practices/}{\underline{Open Source Hardware Association}} has some best practice tips. 
\item[$\bullet$]Please consult the {\it HardwareX} \href{https://www.elsevier.com/journals/hardwarex/2468-0672/guide-for-authors}{\underline{Guide for Authors}} when preparing your manuscript; it highlights mandatory requirements and is packed with useful advice. We have also developed a \href{https://www.journals.elsevier.com/hardwarex/submit-your-hardware/how-to-submit-your-scientific-hardware-article-to-hardwarex}{\underline{step-by-step video guide}} to help you complete this template accurately and increase your chances of acceptance.
