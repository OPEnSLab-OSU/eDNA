## Overview

This Folder contains the LaTeX and asset files for a HardwareX Paper (2024). This README will serve as a quick setup guide for those unfamiliar with using LaTeX locally on their computers. 

## Recommended Windows Setup

To setup a LaTeX development environment for Windows, I would recommend using TexMaker and MikTex. TexMaker is a LaTeX editor and MikTex is a Tex Distribution. Both are needed to be able to work on and compile LaTeX files. For TexMaker I would recommend setting quick build to PDFLaTeX + Bib(la)tex + PDFLaTeX (x2) + View PDF
