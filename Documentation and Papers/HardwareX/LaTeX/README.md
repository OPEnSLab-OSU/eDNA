## Overview

This Folder contains the LaTeX and asset files for a HardwareX Paper (2024). This README will serve as a quick setup guide for those unfamiliar with using LaTeX locally on their computers. 

## Recommended Windows Setup

To setup a LaTeX development environment for Windows, I would recommend using TexMaker and MikTex. TexMaker is a LaTeX editor and MikTex is a Tex Distribution. Both are needed to be able to work on and compile LaTeX files. For TexMaker, go to "Options/Configure Texmaker/Quick Build" and set the quick build to "PDFLaTeX + Bib(la)tex + PDFLaTeX (x2) + View PDF". This is needed in order for the Bibliography/Reference Page to compile correctly. When you first compile in TexMaker, MikTex will open windows requesting for packages to be installed, this will most likely fail the first time stating an issue with the "tabu" package. To resolve this open MikTex Console, go to packages, and search for and manualy install the tabu package.
