/* MS5803_02_test.ino
  This version *only works* with the MS5803-02BA sensor, not the other
  pressure models (like the MS5803-30BA, MS5803-01BA etc). You can find
  libraries for those other models at http://github.com/millerlp
  
  A basic sketch to test communication with a Measurement Specialties MS5803
  pressure sensor. The MS5803 should be hooked up in I2C communication mode
  (PS pin 6 tied to Vdd) and I2C address 0x76 (CSB pin 3 tied to Vdd).
  Use 10k ohm resistors between the SDA pin and Vdd (+3.3V), and 
  SCL and Vdd (+3.3V) to keep the I2C lines from floating. 
  The MS5803 cannot tolerate 5V supply voltage or data links, so use 3.3V 
  to power it. On a 5V Arduino, you may use the 3.3V output to power the
  the MS5803, and put a 10k ohm resistor between SDA line and the +3.3V supply,
  as well as a 10k ohm resistor between  SCLK line and +3.3V supply to limit 
  the data lines to 3.3V max.
