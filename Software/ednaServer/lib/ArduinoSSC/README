Honeywell TruStability High Accuracy Silicon Ceramic (HSC) Series and Standard 
Accuracy Silicon Ceramic (SSC) Series are piezoresistive silicon pressure 
sensors offering a digital output for reading pressure over the specified full 
scale pressure span and temperature range. They are available in standard 
pressure ranges from 1 psi to 150 psi (60 mbar to 10 bar) and are intended for 
use with non-corrosive, non-ionic gases, such as air and other dry gases. 
The liquid media option extends the performance of these sensors to 
non-corrosive, non-ionic liquids.

The library uses I2C to connect to the sensor (see the Wire library). 
SPI can also be used (with some sensors, see datasheet), but is not implemented 
in this library.

If you have multiple devices connected to the I2C bus, remember that this 
device screws up the bus when it is not powered.
One solution is to keep the device powered all the time.
Another possible solution is to add an analog switch to physically disconnect 
the GND and Vsupply line or SCL and SDA line to the device. 
This needs more testing.

Check your sensor before you begin: some of them work with 3.3V some with 5V.

This library has been tested, but might still contain bugs, so please be careful.

Bugs, suggestions, comments are always welcome.
